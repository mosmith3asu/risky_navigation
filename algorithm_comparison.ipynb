    "# Algorithm Comparison for Next-Action Prediction (with Hyperparameter Tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive comparison of different algorithms for next-action prediction in the risky navigation environment, following machine learning best practices with proper hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithms Evaluated:**\n",
    "- **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**: Reinforcement learning approach\n",
    "- **AutoEncoder**: Neural network encoder-decoder architecture  \n",
    "- **Bayesian**: Bayesian neural network with uncertainty quantification\n",
    "- **Transformer**: Self-attention based model\n",
    "- **Linear**: Simple linear regression baseline\n",
    "- **VAE**: Variational AutoEncoder with probabilistic latent representations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices Workflow:**\n",
    "1. **Data Collection & Preparation**: Collect training data and split into train/validation sets\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: For each algorithm, perform cross-validation hyperparameter search\n",
    "3. **Model Training**: Train each algorithm with optimal hyperparameters found\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Test final models on unseen data and compare performance\n",
    "5. **Analysis**: Comprehensive results analysis with visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures fair comparison by optimizing each algorithm's hyperparameters before evaluation."
